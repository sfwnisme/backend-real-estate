# Real Estate Complete Backend

Real estate websites are among the most competitive projects when it comes to SEO ranking. While the frontend is responsible for implementing SEO standards such as schema markups, SSR, SSG, and semantic HTML best practices to achieve strong technical SEO, it must also be supported by a well-structured backend.

This backend support involves delivering well-organized, structured API data that aligns with SEO requirements. Instead of handling these structures solely on the frontend which can increase performance overhead and complexity the backend should provide optimized and validated data tailored for SEO.

This project, therefore, focuses on SEO-first backend support, meaning the database schema and architecture are designed to fully meet and enhance SEO standard requirements.
